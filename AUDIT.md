# Biofeedback Pipeline — Spec Compliance Audit

**Date:** 2026-05-25
**Auditor reference:** `shayans_biofeedback_math_pipeline (12).docx`, `shayans_biofeedback_walkthrough (10).docx`, `biofeedback_acrophobia_framework_valid.drawio.png`

## Executive summary

The math pipeline is **fully implemented** end-to-end. Steps 0–10 plus the `Step ✓` per-tick outputs are all live. R-peak detection now produces realistic HR (75–109 BPM) and RMSSD (6–40 ms) from the mock ECG channel, so the stress calculation actually has signal to work with. Three difficulty modes (easy / moderate / intense) are wired through with the spec's altitude ranges and rate constants. The dashboard reflects mode and per-state time-in-session. A LIVE-phase cap (default 5 min) ends sessions cleanly; operator Ctrl+C still works.

**The pipeline is correct.** The remaining gaps are all integration-layer items (Unity client, real device test, archive review tooling) — none of them affect the math.

Legend: ✅ implemented · 🟡 partial / interpretation diff · ❌ missing

| Step | Requirement | Status | Where |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 0 | LSL transport, 50 Hz internal loop, ZOH | ✅ | [acquisition.py](src/acquisition.py), [streamer.py](src/streamer.py) |
| 0 | EDA in μS, ECG in mV (PLUX hardware conversions) | ✅ | [data_sources.py](src/data_sources.py) |

| ✓  | elapsed baseline time | ❌ | Not in LSL. Dashboard infers from its tick counter. |
| ✓  | mode | 🟡 | Recorded in session CSV; **not** in LSL stream. Unity needs this once it exists. |

## Known gaps (not blockers, but tomorrow's work)

### Integration

1. **No Unity client / VR scene.** We emit on LSL but nothing consumes the target `y_t`. When Unity is built, it should:
   - Subscribe to `Biofeedback_State` (12 channels).
   - On session start, push a 1-channel `Biofeedback_Mode` LSL stream that main.py reads to call `FusionEngine.set_mode(mode)`. The hook already exists.
   - Apply per-frame lerp on `y_t` for smooth motion (Step 9d).

2. **No real PLUX device dry-run.** Set `Config.DATA_SOURCE = 'real_plux'`, start OpenSignals, run `python launcher.py`. The pipeline should connect through `RealPLUXDataSource` without any other code change.

3. **No session-archive viewer.** Per-session CSVs accumulate in `data/` but there's no UI to browse them. A `session_review.py` that:
   - Lists every `data/session_*.csv`.
   - Lets you select one and replays its charts.
   - Exports a one-page summary (mode, duration, time-in-state, sigma, artifacts).
   
   This closes the "Monitoring and Analysis → Data Logger" box in the diagram.

### Spec output completeness

4. **LSL stream is missing 3 of the spec's per-tick outputs:** `baseline_status` (bool), `elapsed_baseline_time` (seconds since start), `mode` (enum). To add: extend `UnityBridge.CHANNELS` to 15, pass through from `main.py`. Dashboard currently derives these from local state — fine for now, but Unity will need them.

### Edge cases

5. **Mock data file is only 42.6 s long, baseline is 120 s.** `MockDataSource.get_next_sample()` loops back to index 0 when it runs out, so the 120 s baseline collects ~3 cycles of identical samples. This artificially shrinks `σ_baseline`, which then locks the thresholds tight. **Not a bug, a mock-data limitation.** Real PLUX or a longer mock file fixes it. For QA, you could also shorten `BASELINE_SEC` to 40 in Config to fit one mock cycle.

6. **R-peak detection threshold is fixed at 60% of the 99th percentile.** Robust on the current mock file. Real PLUX recordings with low-amplitude QRS could need re-tuning. Currently this `0.6` factor is hardcoded in [data_sources.py:derive_hr_hrv_from_ecg](src/data_sources.py); should move to Config for tuning.

### Auditing

7. **`personal_baselines` not written as a one-shot record.** They appear in every LIVE-phase row of the session CSV (same values repeated), so post-hoc extraction is trivial. But a header block or sidecar JSON would be cleaner. Optional.

### UX

8. **Artifact counter on dashboard still shows "--".** The count exists in `proc.artifacts_removed` but isn't on LSL. Easiest fix: extend the LSL stream by 3 more channels (`artifacts_eda`, `artifacts_hr`, `artifacts_hrv`) or write a sidecar `data/session_status.json` polled by the dashboard.

9. **Dashboard color scheme is hardcoded.** RGB tuples for calm / stressed / ultra in `dashboard.py:152-154`. Move to Config if you want easy theming.

## Recommended order for tomorrow

If you only have 1 hour:
1. **Add 3 LSL channels** (`baseline_status`, `elapsed_baseline_sec`, `mode_enum`) → spec-complete output. ~20 min.
2. **Build `session_review.py`** → close the audit-loop gap. ~30 min.
3. **Run with real PLUX** if device is available → first end-to-end real-data test.

If you have a full day:
1. Above three.
2. **Move ECG height factor + dashboard colors + log dir to Config** → finish the configurability sweep. ~15 min.
3. **Write the Unity LSL consumer stub** (Python script that subscribes to `Biofeedback_State` and prints/logs y_t — proves the contract from the other side). ~30 min.
4. **Validate three-session sweep:** run easy → moderate → intense with the same patient name, then open each session CSV in Excel/pandas and confirm `session_mode` column distinguishes them. ~15 min.

| `HRV_PLOT_DEFAULT_RANGE` | `(0, 200)` ms | Y bounds for the HRV chart before baseline locks |
| `EDA_PLOT_HALFRANGE` | `3.0` μS | After baseline locks, EDA chart spans `avg_eda ± halfrange` |
| `HR_PLOT_HALFRANGE` | `25.0` BPM | After baseline locks, HR chart spans `avg_hr ± halfrange` |
| `HRV_PLOT_HALFRANGE` | `30.0` ms | After baseline locks, HRV chart spans `avg_hrv ± halfrange` |
| (hardcoded) RGB in `dashboard.py:152-154` | — | calm/stressed/ultra background colors. Move to Config for theming. |

### LSL output
| Knob | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `OUT_STREAM_NAME` | `"Biofeedback_State"` | Outbound LSL stream name |
| `OUT_STREAM_TYPE` | `"Control"` | LSL stream type tag |
| `UnityBridge.CHANNELS` (in `output.py`) | 12 channels | See [DATA_FLOW.md](DATA_FLOW.md) Layer 8 for the layout |

## How to verify each fix tomorrow

| Check | How |
|-------|-----|
| HR/HRV vary | Watch the HR and HRV charts during baseline; they should oscillate. They did in this audit's screenshot. |
| Personal Baseline populates | After T=120 s, the bottom-left panel switches from "-- μS" to real numbers. |
| Threshold lines appear | After T=120 s, yellow (mild) and red (high) dashed lines render across the stress chart. |
| y_t responds to state | Stay calm → balloon altitude climbs toward y_high. Spike EDA → y_t drops if state reaches ultra. |
| Session mode shown | Top of dashboard reads `Session: EASY` (or whatever `Config.SESSION_MODE` is). |
| Session ends on cap | After 5 min of LIVE phase the pipeline prints "SESSION COMPLETE" and exits. Cleanly. |
| CSV records mode + artifacts | Open `data/session_*.csv` in Excel; columns `session_mode`, `artifacts_eda`, `artifacts_hr`, `artifacts_hrv` are present. |
| Three sessions distinguishable | Run with `SESSION_MODE='easy'`, then `'moderate'`, then `'intense'`. Three CSVs, each with its mode in every row. |
